By 1645 he acquired land in Virginia, although he continued as a ship captain and died in England. John Flower (b.1624) and Jacob Flower (b.1635), two sons of John Flower II, emigrated in 1656 from England to the land purchased by their father in what is now Surry County, Virginia. Descendants (chiefly spelling the surname Flowers) and relatives lived in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Texas and elsewhere. Includes some ancestral records and genealogical data in England to ca. 1542.",

    description: "Inspiring new ways to connect with the beauty of flowers in everyday life. Like the author’s exquisite first book, Bringing Nature Home, this much-awaited follow-up title presents stunning arrangements and ideas for interiors inspired by the beauty of flowers. Ngoc Minh Ngo has recorded the work of artists, designers, and tastemakers who demonstrate the many ways that flowers can enhance our homes and work spaces. Each chapter focuses on a unique way to incorporate floral designs into interiors, from flower arrangements made from foraged greenery to wall painting evoking Monet’s water lilies to paper flowers that never lose their vibrancy. Renowned photographer Oberto Gili fills his house in Italy with treasures from his bountiful garden that inspire his work, and landscape designer Miranda Brooks puts to use her passion for all things botanical in the decoration of her beautiful Brooklyn home. With exceptional photography that captures the beauty of these flower-inspired homes and text that shares how these imaginative artists and designers achieved their botanical creations, this is an irresistible book for flower lovers, decorators, and homeowners.",
